# Business Search Engine

# Summary
The Business Search Engine project aims to help start-ups define their market by providing a natural language search engine for services and businesses, utilizing the DPR algorithm and SBERT for improved search capabilities. <br>
The project is in the planning stage and is scheduled from September 7, 2024, to December 31, 2024.

## About this project

Defining a market has always been a difficult task for people in the start-up scene, as they often encounter or operate businesses that cannot be classified using traditional market categories. <br>
They need to configure their own market with criteria such as business model or special product.

In this project, we aim to mitigate this issue by providing a search engine that can search for services and businesses using natural language, allowing them to easily find businesses that satisfy their unique criteria. <br>
We leverage the DPR algorithm for the search engine and SBERT as the embedding model.
